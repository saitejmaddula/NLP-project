But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need.

"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,199.99,1,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,19

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.",1

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,4,"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.",12

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.",17

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,2,"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.",9

In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!",3

The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.",12

(LANDVO) 5.0" Capacitive Touch MTK6582 Quad Core Android 4.2.2 3G Phone 512MB RAM 4GB ROM 2MP CAM WiFi GPS - Black,HTM,69.99,5,"Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the ""cheapest quad-core phone,"" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0"" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.",16

I use it on Straighttalk unlimited plan as a 3g phone on AT&T 4g SIM. It has a lot of Chinese apps that you can remove. The viewing angles on screen are not the best. However it looks really sharp straight on. Has excellent quality picture and video (Netflix) . Very Poor Camera!!! Texts to all networks that can be reached by AT&T. I have friends on them all. Is a 4.4.2 android kitty Kat so it can use all the Google apps. The voice search is excellent . If it can decipher my worn out gravely southern accent every time. It should work well for you. Great phone for international travel just pop a European SIM in the extra slot and you are in business. If this phablet had a better camera it would be a steal. The battery will last for days if just used for phone. When you surf and use Wi-Fi continuously you will need to recharge more often. It is going to be kept and used,7

3 Pack Replacement Belt Clip Holster for Otterbox Iphone 5 Defender Case - Black,OtterBox,17.95,5,"Like a number of other reviewers I break these holsters every 3 months or so. Otterbox is good with their warranty but honestly it is a pain ( I get that - there are a lot of knock-offs). Their main competitor is even worse (no names mentioned). I like the Otterbox and have used them on three phones - all had the same issue with holster breakage. So I decided to give these generic holsters a try. I am one month into using them (and have two back-ups) - so far there have been no issues and they appear to look and work as well as the Otterbox brand at a fraction of the cost. If I break all three I will buy three more - easier and faster to get than replacements from Otterbox (not to even mention their ""competitor"". If you are willing to take a chance and ""go generic"" they are a good choice. July 15, 2016 3 1/2 months later - I am still using the first one. It looks like new and works perfectly. I do not treat these gently and am really happy with them thus far.",1

I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5"" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look ""uncool"" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way.",4

The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it.

5.0" Cell Phones Unlocked Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5.0MP Camera Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING GSM/3G Smartphone White,JUNING,89.99,5,"This is an amazing phone. I purchased the 6in for myself, and came back a week later, and bought the 5in for a friend. We are both really impressed with this phone. It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are ""given the phones in exchange for a review"", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have. Thank you Amazon for providing such good products.",10

Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished),Apple,129.99,2,At first there were two problems with the product iPhone 4s unlocked I purchased . The WiFi tab was greyed out dim and I can't connect to Internet even I have a sim card with high speed internet and Wi Fi at home. There is no cellular data network tab on the phone to edit the APN. I called Wireless 2 go They told me they had never had this issue before and they were ready to refund me and sent me a label to return the product. After consideration I decided not to return the product. I reset and erased all the the content and network and started activating the iPhone again. It was a hard time! Finally the Wi Fi tab works and the Internet is connected. However when I browsed Google the Wi Fi stopped working and the screen displayed "could not activate cellular dater network" . I had to redo everything again. Totally 3 times. Now it is connected to Wi Fi and Internet but I don't know how long this status can maintain. I even dare not to browse Google website on this iphone. I think the shadow of the former carrier is still there even the phone is unlocked. Is there a way to find out the cellular data network tab and APN to solve this problem?Anyway I have to say that this iPhone 4s has a good look and almost no scratches.,0

Blu Dash JR D141W Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone,BLU,40,2,"I bought 2 of these phones as Christmas gifts for my kids. They are always asking to play Candy Crush or Talking Tom on our phones, so we decided to get them each one of their own. For the price, I thought this was a steal. After setting them up and trying to use them, I realized it was a robbery. Where my Note 3 takes a couple seconds to load Candy Crush, the Dash JR takes literally up to a full minute. Often times the kids would open it and just get some white screen. The market constantly crashed so downloading new games was impossible. I ended up returning them both and buying 2 of the Boost Mobile LG Volt. For $10 more each, I got a phone with Kit Kat (instead of Gingerbread which this phone runs), which has a much better front and rear camera (with flash), much faster processor, more RAM, much larger screen and everything works as expected. Please don't waste your money on this phone!",1

Upon recieving the phone I became oh so aware of how ""used"" it was. This is a self proclaimed ""rugged phone"" so why is it that when I just simply flip the phone close it shuts off. I'm not dropping it from 5ft let alone 1 inch, I'm simply shutting the phone as you have to with flip phones! I've come to the conclusion that it must be the battery, either loose or something causing it to jar off the power mechanism therefore loosing battery power.Bottom Line: ""you get what you pay for"" very true statement, ""you expect to get what was described to you by seller, and then when it gets to you its all a lie and a piece of junk"" also very true of this product.",0
