NLP project on Reviews Analysis
Today the online sales has been so tremendous and people buy a lot of products
from A to Z online and this has also an added advantage because it allows the
consumers to connect to the people round the globe.The number of online sellers is
growing rapidly so as the consumers.But people can wanted to know whether the
seller can be trusted or not and if the product is genuine and what if one can know
without actually buying them.Yes it is good but how is that several tend to leave the
reviews based on the usage of the product and this trend has gone good and thus
there is introduction of star rating so as to reduce and time of people and also to get
the average view of product it is very helpful.But the question is that is the star
rating is true opinion because it is so common that when a person finds a small fault
he is mostly likely to give a 1 star rating rather than 3 or 4 star rating which is its true
rating.Consider the few examples listed below:
1. Review: “ was not in good condition but does work good “

Rating from context : 3

Rating given : 1

Clearly we can see that a lot of difference one could make from context to that
actual one as there is a lot of difference in giving 1 and 3 star rating

2. Review: “ I like these phone I bought it for my mom and she loves it “

Rating from context : 4

Rating given : 2

I am trying to predict the rating from the context and then give the true average
product from a specified list of products available.
